# leaflet Mapping Project
Repository contains files for the leaflet Mapping Project.
This project creates a web page that displays a map with the birthplace location of all
the US presidents on it. Each birthplace is denoted by a portrait of the president
and the popup contains their presidency number, name, birthplace and year of birth.

- President Portraits folder contains jpegs of presidental portraits from wikipages. Used to make the icons.
- president.xlsx has source data (mostly from wiki)
- president.csv is created from president.xlsx. Much easier reading in a csv into R.
- presidential birthplaces.Rmd is the source file
- presidential_birthplaces.html is the web page product
